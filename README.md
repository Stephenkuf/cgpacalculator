# cgpacalculator   
# this is a cgpa calculator that uses a while loop.
it collects the score , converts it into points, and multiplies it with the units of that course and then saves it into a variable .
the process is repeated until the no oof courses is complete. 
and then the cumulasted points*units is divided by the cumulated units .
which gives the CGPA
